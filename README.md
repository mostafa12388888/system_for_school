# School System

I have successfully developed a comprehensive educational system that effectively organizes students, teachers, and parents. This system incorporates features such as quiz creation and multiple gateways for enhanced functionality. Additionally, it allows the addition of stages, classes, and academic subjects, establishing relationships between them and their respective teachers. Students are also rewarded for their achievements, and the system enables the sending of Zoom links for online classes. This project utilized technologies such as Livewire, Mcamara Laravel Localization, Spatie Translatable, and Ajax to deliver a seamless user experience.
